# Python Backtesting Platform

My side project, inspired by [Computational Investing course](https://www.coursera.org/course/compinvesting1),
which allows you to execute (stock market) orders in your
virtual portfolio and see total value of assets held and etc. This is my first project using NumPy and Pandas
and I have learned A LOT already & had great fun.

The application is in very early stages and plenty planned to get done!

# Dependencies

The project uses [QSTK library](http://wiki.quantsoftware.org/index.php?title=QuantSoftware_ToolKit)
as an abstraction layer for getting market-related data. List of dependencies is available [here](http://wiki.quantsoftware.org/index.php?title=QSToolKit_Installation_Guide).

# TODOs

List of tasks in the pipeline at the moment (in on the order of expected completion):

1. Import list of orders from a file/database (DONE)
2. Implement short positions (only long available now)
3. Implement a basic UI (instead of running run.py)

Those are the plans for v1.0
